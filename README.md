PEER-GRADED ASSIGNMENT!

This repo is a submission for Coursera, the "Getting and Cleaning Data" final
project. The data contains information regarding human physical activity, the 
nature of that activity, and data collected through a cellphone that takes 
different measurements. This project allowed me to use many different tools in 
the dplyr package, and I am excited to continue exploring the possibilities of
this package. The variables and data in this project are meant to be
self-explanatory by their name, however I understand if there is any confusion.
Thank you for reading my work!
